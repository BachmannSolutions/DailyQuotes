## DailyQuotes
This project is the final requirement for the Code Louisville's May 2021 Python Session.

The intention of this app is to enable the user to view a new quote daily.

## Code Louisville Project Requirements met
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
2. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
3. [not utilized yet] Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
4. [not utilized yet] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)

## Features to be added later
- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into app to allow auto-generation of quotes instead of manually loading each to .txt file
- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format to push new quote daily to user, via email or other means
