## DailyQuotes
This project is the final requirement for the Code Louisville's Python Course.

The intention of this project is to share something that is important to my wife and I with others. We are a collector of quotes and I thought this would be a neat way to share quotes we've gathered throughout the years with others. By using the program, the user is enabled to view a new quote daily. 

## Code Louisville Project Requirements met
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
2. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

## Features to be added later
- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into app to allow auto-generation of quotes instead of manually loading each to .txt file
- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format to push new quote daily to user, via email or other means
